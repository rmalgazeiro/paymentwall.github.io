Brick is a pure credit card payment solution provided by Paymentwall. It allows you to develop your own payment experience for credit cards payments specifically.

## Try with Brick

By using Brick test cards in [Sanbox](/paymentwall.github.io/brick/sandbox) or card information below to do a test payment.

* Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242.

* Expiry date: 03/21.

* CVV: 097.

* Email: test@paymentwall.com.

Each successful payment has a one-time token to be used in further charge request.

## Components

* [Create form](/paymentwall.github.io/brick/create-form) to collect payment details and generate one-time token. 

* Perform request according to your product type, [onetime payment](/paymentwall.github.io/brick/charge) or [subscription](/paymentwall.github.io/brick/subscription).

## Requirements

See how to [apply 3D Secure](/paymentwall.github.io/brick/3dSecure) in Brick.
