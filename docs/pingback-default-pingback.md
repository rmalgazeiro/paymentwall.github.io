# Pingbacks
When user pays or completes an offer, we will send a pingback which will notify your server regarding the transactions.
<br>
Pingback request is sent from our servers to your Pingback listener script 
where we communicate to your server regarding the details about payment transactions 
so that your server can process the pingback automatically and deliver the goods to the according users.
<br>
In project settings area, please input the Pingback URL which is the URL address of your script that processes the pingbacks.

## Request Method
GET, POST

## Pingback Return Value
