# Virtual Currency

Please make sure your project is configured as **Virtual Currency API** before starting.

## Setup price points

By using virtual currency, you can add your own price points to specific payment method. Do following steps to configure your price points.

* Access your **project settings** and set the virtual currency exchange rate and name of your virtual currency. For example, lets set the virtual currency like 1 USD = 15 Gold coins:

<div class="docs-img">
    <img src="/textures/pic/hosted/pw_project_vc_exchange_rate.png">
</div>

* You can also set more than one currency exchange clicking on **Manage Currency Rates**. So your project will have an USD exchange rate, and an EUR exchange rate for EUR region:

<div class="docs-img">
    <img src="/textures/pic/hosted/pw_project_vc_custom_xe.png">
</div>

* You can then register your price points in Paymentwall side. In **Price Points** area, choose the payment systems where you want to set price points in and add yours there.

</div>

> Mobiamo has its own price points which are declared by mobile operators. New price points are not acceptable for Mobiamo.

You will also see how much virtual currency the customer is purchasing (this is calculated according to the virtual currency exchange rate).
